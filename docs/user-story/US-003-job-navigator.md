# US-003: Job-Navigator and Moeglichkeitsraum

**Created:** 2026-02-17

## User Story
As a **student**, I want the **Job-Navigator to show me job possibilities related to my interests — including contrary and unexpected options (Gegensatzsuche)** — so that **I understand the full "Moeglichkeitsraum" (possibility space) of what I could become**.

## Context
The Job-Navigator does not recommend a career. It opens a possibility space. A student interested in "Kochen" sees not only "Koch/Koechin" but also food science, agricultural engineering, restaurant management, food photography, nutrition therapy — and through Gegensatzsuche, deliberately contrasting options like "Lebensmittelkontrolle" (food inspection) or "Ernaehrungsberatung" (nutrition consulting). Job data comes from real job portals, grounded in actual market demand. The navigator explains what each job involves in student-friendly language, powered by Wikipedia and job portal data.

## Acceptance Indicators
- Job-Navigator surfaces related job ideas based on interest profile
- Gegensatzsuche offers deliberately contrasting/opposite job ideas
- Job descriptions are sourced from real job portal data
- Explanations are age-appropriate and jargon-free (Wikipedia as knowledge base)
- Student sees a "possibility space" — not a single recommendation
- The Moeglichkeitsraum grows as the interest profile deepens
