# US-008: Company Moeglichkeitsraum — Companies Show Their Perspective

**Created:** 2026-02-17

## User Story
As a **company**, I want to **present my Moeglichkeitsraum — the perspectives, career paths, and growth opportunities I offer — to young people who match my needs** so that **I attract motivated talent that already has genuine interest in my domain, not just applicants chasing a title**.

## Context
The system flips the hiring dynamic. Companies cannot passively post a job listing and wait. To be visible in a student's Moeglichkeitsraum, a company must actively describe what perspectives it offers — not just "we need a Mechatroniker" but "here's what working with us looks like, here's where you can grow, here's why this is meaningful."

This is the company's responsibility: to be attractive, they must articulate their own Moeglichkeitsraum. Students see companies not as job posters but as places that offer futures. A match emerges when a student's interest profile aligns with what a company genuinely offers.

The company does not access student profiles directly. Matching is mediated by the platform. The student decides whether to reveal their profile.

## Acceptance Indicators
- Companies can describe their Moeglichkeitsraum (roles, growth paths, perspectives)
- Company profiles surface during the Job-Navigator when interests align
- Students see companies as "perspectives" not "job listings"
- Match quality depends on how well the company articulates its offering
- Student controls whether a match leads to contact (consent-based)
