# US-013: AI Reisebegleiter — Agents als Begleitung auf der Reise

**Created:** 2026-02-17

## User Story
As a **student on the VUCA journey**, I want to be guided by AI agents who feel like travel companions so that **the journey feels personal, supportive, and alive — not like interacting with a chatbot or filling out a form**.

## Context
The user's input captured a key vision: "Unsere Agents nehmen Dich mit auf die Reise." The journey should not feel like a single monolithic AI interaction. Instead, multiple agent personas — each with a distinct role (exploration guide, reflective coach, skill verifier, matching facilitator) — create a richer, more human-like experience.

This applies at every life stage: a 14-year-old starting with curiosity gets an exploratory companion; an adult in a career dead-end ("Sackgasse") gets a re-orientation agent that builds on existing profile data. The agents are always there, ready to pick up wherever the user left off.

The agent ensemble also serves the chamber and company perspectives: when a match opportunity arises, the matching agent mediates — always with the student's consent.

## Acceptance Indicators
- The student perceives distinct companion "modes" during the journey (exploration, reflection, matching) without needing to understand the technical separation
- The agents maintain context across sessions — they "remember" the journey
- An adult re-entering the system is met by an agent that acknowledges existing profile data and adapts accordingly
- The experience feels like being accompanied, not interrogated or lectured
