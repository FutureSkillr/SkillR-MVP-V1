# US-015: Kammer und Jobagentur als Wegweiser im VUCA-Ökosystem

**Created:** 2026-02-17

## User Story
As a **chamber representative or job agency counselor**, I want to provide orientation context within the VUCA journey so that **students discover relevant apprenticeship possibilities naturally — as part of their exploration, not as a separate career counseling session**.

## Context
The transcript identifies chambers (IHK, Handwerkskammer) and the Arbeitsamt/Jobagentur as key multipliers and orientation providers. Their current methods (Multiple-Choice career assessments, Tag der Ausbildung) are seen as insufficient.

In the VUCA-Lernwelt, their role is **Wegweiser** (signpost/navigator). They don't accompany the journey directly — they provide the landscape that the student explores. Specifically:

- **General landscape**: "These are the apprenticeship categories that exist in Germany"
- **Regional specifics**: "In your region (Einzugsbereich), these specific positions are open"
- **Demand signals**: "This trade has high demand right now" (FR-023)
- **Novel positions**: Companies can register positions that don't yet exist in the standard IHK catalog (transcript line 392: "eine Industrie muss in der Lage sein, einen neuen Bedarf, den es bei der IHK noch gar nicht gibt, einspielen zu können")

The Wegweiser role is invisible to the student — the landscape simply exists. But the chamber representative sees aggregate analytics: what are students interested in? Where are the gaps between supply and demand?

## Acceptance Indicators
- A chamber representative can manage their apprenticeship landscape data through the dashboard (FR-021)
- The Arbeitsamt counselor can use Future Skiller as a complement to their existing counseling ("das hilft euch bei eurer Arbeit")
- Students encounter apprenticeship possibilities naturally during their VUCA journey, not as a bolt-on career station
- Chamber representatives see anonymized aggregate interest trends in their region
- Companies can register non-standard positions through the chamber channel
- The IHK Ausbildungsmanager says: "Das ist ein geiles Vorbereitungstool"
