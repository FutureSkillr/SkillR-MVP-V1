# US-014: Eltern als Motivator im VUCA-Ökosystem

**Created:** 2026-02-17

## User Story
As a **parent**, I want to see my child's VUCA journey progress and understand their emerging interests so that **I can encourage and support them meaningfully — without controlling or steering their path**.

## Context
Parents are the enablers of the youth journey. They control access (device, time, financial support), and their buy-in is essential for sustained engagement. In the transcript discussion, parents are identified as one of four primary target groups.

Parents need to feel:
- **Informed** — "I can follow what my child did" (Checkliste.md)
- **Reassured** — the app is not a time-waster but a genuine discovery tool
- **Empowered** — they can encourage without dictating career choices

Their role in the VUCA-Lernwelt: **Motivator**. They see aggregated progress (not raw interactions), receive milestone notifications, and can celebrate achievements with their child. They do NOT see detailed dialogue content (privacy boundary).

The parent view transforms the abstract "mein Kind ist auf dem Handy" into "mein Kind entdeckt gerade Interessen im Bereich Natur und Technik."

## Acceptance Indicators
- A parent can log in and see a summary of their child's VUCA journey progress
- The parent sees interest clusters and VUCA bingo status — not raw chat content
- The parent receives milestone notifications (e.g., "VUCA-Dimension Complexity explored")
- The parent says: "Ich verstehe, was mein Kind da macht, und finde es gut"
- Privacy boundary: detailed interactions remain private to the student
