# US-012: Lifelong Re-Entry — Any Age, Any Situation

**Created:** 2026-02-17

## User Story
As a **person at any stage of life — whether 14 and exploring, 25 and stuck, or 45 and in a dead end ("Sackgasse")**, I want to **start or restart the journey and transform new interests into orientation and skills** so that **I always have a way forward, regardless of my past**.

## Context
The system is not only for teenagers. The Interest → Orientation → Skills transformation works at any point in life. A 45-year-old in a career dead end can open the app, name a new interest, and begin a fresh VUCA journey. The agents take them on the trip ("Unsere Agents nehmen Dich mit auf die Reise").

What changes across life stages:
- **Youth (14-18):** First journey. Everything is new. Wide exploration.
- **Young adult (18-25):** Deepening. Existing profile grows. Orientation sharpens into skills.
- **Career change (25-45):** Re-entry. New interest seeds. Existing skills remain, new branches grow.
- **Late career (45+):** Reinvention. The profile proves transferable skills. New Moeglichkeitsraum opens.

The profile is cumulative — re-entry does not erase the past. New interests layer onto existing ones. The system recognizes returning users and builds on their history.

## Acceptance Indicators
- New journey can be started at any time without losing existing profile
- Agent-guided experience adapts to the user's life stage
- Existing skills are preserved when exploring new interests
- No age gate, no prerequisite, no "you're too old for this"
- The Moeglichkeitsraum expands with each re-entry
