# US-001: Interest Profile Discovery

**Created:** 2026-02-17

## User Story
As a **student**, I want to **discover and track my interest profile through dialogue with the AI assistant** so that **I understand what genuinely interests me before anyone tells me what career to pursue**.

## Context
The journey begins with a conversation. The student names an interest — anything: wood, cooking, history. The system captures this as the seed of an interest profile. Through continued dialogue, the profile deepens: the system observes not just what the student says, but what they choose, what they skip, how they respond. The interest profile is not a questionnaire result — it emerges organically from interaction.

## Acceptance Indicators
- Student can start with any free-form interest topic
- System tracks chosen topics, ignored options, and response patterns
- Interest profile grows incrementally across sessions
- Student can view their evolving profile at any time
- Profile feels like self-recognition, not external labeling
