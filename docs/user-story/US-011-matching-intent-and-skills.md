# US-011: Matching on Intention/Interest and Verified Skills

**Created:** 2026-02-17

## User Story
As a **student**, I want the system to **match me with opportunities on two levels — my intentions/interests and my verified skills** so that **I find opportunities that fit both what I care about and what I can demonstrably do**.

## Context
Matching operates at two distinct levels:

1. **Intention/Interest matching** — "This student is genuinely interested in renewable energy." Based on the interest profile derived from the VUCA journey. Available early, even before skills are verified. Connects students to opportunities that align with what they care about.

2. **Verified skill matching** — "This student has demonstrated analytical thinking about material science, evidenced by portfolio entries X, Y, Z." Based on the portfolio-backed skill profile. Available after sufficient journey depth. Connects students to opportunities that require specific capabilities.

Both levels can produce matches, but they mean different things. An interest match says "this person would enjoy exploring this." A skill match says "this person has demonstrated readiness for this." Companies and chambers see both signals, weighted differently depending on the context.

The student always controls visibility. Matching is opt-in. No profile is shared without explicit consent.

## Acceptance Indicators
- Two distinct match types: interest-based and skill-based
- Interest matching works from early journey stages
- Skill matching requires portfolio evidence
- Student controls which matches are visible and to whom
- Companies see match quality indicators (interest strength, skill evidence depth)
- Matching is mediated — no direct profile access without consent
