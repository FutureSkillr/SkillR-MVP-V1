# US-002: Contextual Exploration Across Dimensions and Places

**Created:** 2026-02-17

## User Story
As a **student**, I want to **explore the same interest in new dimensions, contexts, and geographic places** so that **I see how a single "thing" connects to the wider world and discover aspects I never considered**.

## Context
A student interested in "Holz" should not stay in a single perspective. The system motivates them to see wood through the lens of craftsmanship in Japan, deforestation in Brazil, timber engineering in Scandinavia, or the economics of furniture in Italy. Each new context reveals a different dimension of the same interest — cultural, scientific, economic, ecological. The geographic framing (powered by OpenStreetMap/GeoQB) makes these shifts tangible: you are "traveling" to a real place where this aspect of your interest is alive.

## Acceptance Indicators
- System proposes contextual shifts for the current interest (new place, new angle)
- Geographic locations are real and relevant (OSM/GeoQB data)
- Student encounters their interest through multiple lenses (cultural, technical, economic, ecological)
- Each contextual shift is a choice, not forced
- The journey map shows where the student has "traveled"
