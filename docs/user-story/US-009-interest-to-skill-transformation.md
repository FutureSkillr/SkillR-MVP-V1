# US-009: Interest → Orientation → Skills Transformation

**Created:** 2026-02-17

## User Story
As a **student**, I want the system to **transform my initial interest into orientation, and then into verified skills** so that **what starts as curiosity becomes a documented, portfolio-backed competency that I own**.

## Context
The transformation journey has three stages:

1. **Interest** — "I'm curious about wood." Pure attraction, no commitment. Captured through dialogue choices and engagement patterns during the VUCA journey.
2. **Orientation** — "I understand what working with wood means — craftsmanship, forestry, material science, design." The student has explored dimensions, encountered VUCA, and sees the landscape. The Moeglichkeitsraum is open.
3. **Skills** — "I can identify wood types, I understand sustainable forestry principles, I've demonstrated analytical thinking about material properties." The student has engaged deeply enough that capability indicators and knowledge are evidenced in portfolio entries.

Each stage builds on the previous. The skill profile evolves from a tag cloud of interests into an evidence-backed competency document. The portfolio entries are the proof — not a self-assessment, but a traceable record of interaction, reflection, and demonstrated understanding.

This transformation works at any age. A 14-year-old starts at Interest. A 35-year-old in a career dead end ("Sackgasse") can re-enter at Interest and follow the same path into new Skills.

## Acceptance Indicators
- Profile visibly evolves through the three stages (Interest → Orientation → Skills)
- Each stage has different depth and evidence requirements
- Portfolio entries serve as evidence for skill claims
- The transformation is available at any age, any life situation
- Re-entry is always possible — no one is locked out because of their past
