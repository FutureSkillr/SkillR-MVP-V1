# US-004: Trip to VUCA Completion

**Created:** 2026-02-17

## User Story
As a **student**, I want to **complete my Trip to VUCA once I have collected at least 4 items per VUCA dimension** so that **I have a clear achievement milestone and a complete foundational experience**.

## Context
The Trip to VUCA is not open-ended — it has a finish line. The student must encounter all four VUCA dimensions (Volatility, Uncertainty, Complexity, Ambiguity) in the context of their own interests. The minimum threshold is 4 items per dimension (4x4 = 16 interactions minimum). Each item is a dialogue interaction, station visit, or reflection tagged to a VUCA dimension. The system tracks progress transparently — the student can see which dimensions are covered and which need more exploration. Completion unlocks the full interest profile.

## Acceptance Indicators
- Progress is tracked per VUCA dimension (V, U, C, A)
- Minimum 4 items per dimension required for completion
- Student can see their progress (bingo-style visualization)
- Completion is triggered automatically when thresholds are met
- Journey can be finished at a defined point — no infinite loop
- Completed journey produces the full interest/skill profile
