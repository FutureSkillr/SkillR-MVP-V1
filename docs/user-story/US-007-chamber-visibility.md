# US-007: Chamber Visibility — Apprenticeships and Regional Positions

**Created:** 2026-02-17

## User Story
As a **chamber representative (IHK/Handwerkskammer)**, I want to **make available apprenticeships visible — both the general landscape of training occupations and specific open positions in my chamber's region** — so that **young people discover what exists in the VUCA world of work, and our member companies find motivated candidates**.

## Context
Chambers sit between young people and companies. They know the full landscape of apprenticeships ("Ausbildungsberufe") but struggle to make this landscape visible and attractive to youth. Today's channels (job fairs, BIZ, brochures) reach fewer young people each year.

Future Skiller solves this from the student's side: through the VUCA journey, students naturally encounter occupations connected to their interests. The chamber's role is to ensure the data is complete — that the system knows what apprenticeships exist generally, and what specific positions are open in their region ("Einzugsbereich").

The chamber does not push career recommendations. It makes the landscape visible. The student's own journey determines which parts of that landscape they see.

## Acceptance Indicators
- Chamber can see which apprenticeships are represented in the system
- Regional positions from member companies are surfaceable during the journey
- Students encounter real local apprenticeship options tied to their interests
- Chamber gets aggregate visibility into which occupations attract interest (anonymized)
- No career recommendation — only landscape visibility
