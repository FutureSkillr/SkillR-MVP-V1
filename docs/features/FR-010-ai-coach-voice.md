# FR-010: AI Coach Voice Interaction

**Status:** draft
**Priority:** should
**Created:** 2026-02-17

## Scope
The AI coach (Scout/Coach) speaks to the user using text-to-speech via Gemini voice models. The user can select from available voices. Voice output is critical for the target audience — teenagers engage more naturally with a speaking companion than a text wall. The coach personality should feel like a knowledgeable travel companion, not a teacher.

## Intent
Voice makes the experience personal and immersive. A 14-year-old on a bus can listen instead of read. Voice selection gives a sense of ownership. The coach's tone sets the entire emotional register of the product — it must feel like a conversation, not a lecture.

## Dependencies
- FR-005 (Gemini AI dialogue engine — content generation)
