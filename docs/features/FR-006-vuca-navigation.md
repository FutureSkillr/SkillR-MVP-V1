# FR-006: VUCA Navigation and Exploration

**Status:** draft
**Priority:** must
**Created:** 2026-02-17

## Scope
At every step of the journey, the user is presented with two navigation choices: stay local or jump far, deepen the current topic or switch to something new. The system proposes thematically relevant places (local or global) tied to the user's interest. A "potpourri" principle ensures breadth — the system always offers exits into other topics to prevent interest-bias (not only showing "Holz" because the user once chose "Holz").

## Intent
The journey must feel like exploration, not a tunnel. Two choices at each step keep decisions simple while maintaining agency. The anti-bias mechanism ensures the profile reflects genuine breadth of interest, not a feedback loop. The geographic framing (real places) makes abstract topics tangible.

## Dependencies
- FR-005 (Gemini AI dialogue engine)
- FR-004 (Interest entry — initial topic and location)
