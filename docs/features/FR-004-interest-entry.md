# FR-004: Interest-Based Journey Entry

**Status:** draft
**Priority:** must
**Created:** 2026-02-17

## Scope
The VUCA journey begins with the user choosing a free-form interest topic (e.g., "Holz", "Kochen", "Geschichte"). The system does not present a fixed menu — the user types or speaks whatever interests them. The AI coach picks up the topic and proposes a journey built around it. The starting point is the user's real-world location (geo-coordinate or manual input).

## Intent
Let the user lead. The app must feel like exploration, not a curriculum. Starting from the user's own interest and location creates immediate personal relevance — the opposite of a generic onboarding flow.

## Dependencies
- FR-005 (Gemini AI dialogue engine)
