# FR-009: Profile Visualization

**Status:** draft
**Priority:** must
**Created:** 2026-02-17

## Scope
The skill/interest profile is displayed visually as a spider/radar diagram with dimensions (Hard Skills, Soft Skills, Future Skills, Resilience, and potentially others). The diagram updates visibly after each dialogue interaction or station visit so the user can watch their profile grow. The visualization must be readable and engaging for a 14-year-old audience.

## Intent
Abstract data becomes real when you can see it. The spider diagram makes the invisible (interests, skills) visible and creates a reward loop — "I did something, and my profile changed." Seeing the profile evolve in real time is core motivation for continuing the journey.

## Dependencies
- FR-008 (Skill profile generation — data source)
