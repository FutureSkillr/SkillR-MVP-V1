# FR-021: Chamber Dashboard (Backend + Frontend)

**Status:** draft
**Priority:** could
**Created:** 2026-02-17

## Scope
Dashboard for chamber representatives (IHK/Handwerkskammer) to manage apprenticeship visibility. Shows the landscape of available apprenticeships in their region, aggregate interest statistics (anonymized), and match activity. Chambers can ensure their data is complete and see which occupations attract student interest.

## Intent
Give chambers a reason to participate and invest. The dashboard proves value: "Students in your region are interested in X, but you have no visibility for X-related apprenticeships." Data-driven advice for member companies.

## Dependencies
- FR-017 (Job portal data service — source of apprenticeship data)
- TC-006 (Matching engine — match statistics)
- BC-003 (Chamber visibility concept)
- US-007 (Chamber visibility user story)
