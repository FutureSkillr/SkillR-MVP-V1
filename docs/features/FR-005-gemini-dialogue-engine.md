# FR-005: Gemini AI Dialogue Engine

**Status:** draft
**Priority:** must
**Created:** 2026-02-17

## Scope
Core dialogue system powered by Google Gemini via Google AI Studio. The engine generates dynamic, age-appropriate content based on the user's chosen interest, current journey position, and dialogue history. No pre-authored content — all content is generated from world knowledge. The engine must support context-aware follow-up, station-based interactions with questions, and adaptive responses that avoid generic output.

## Intent
This is the product's core differentiator. The AI coach replaces the need for a content-creation team. The dialogue must feel personal and intelligent — a 14-year-old should feel heard, not lectured. The engine drives the VUCA journey, profile extraction, and all user interaction.

## Dependencies
- FR-003 (Firebase — dialogue history storage)
