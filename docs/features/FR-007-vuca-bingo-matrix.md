# FR-007: VUCA Bingo Completion Matrix

**Status:** draft
**Priority:** must
**Created:** 2026-02-17

## Scope
The VUCA journey has a clear completion criterion: the user must accumulate sufficient experiences across all four VUCA dimensions — Volatility, Uncertainty, Complexity, and Ambiguity. This is tracked as a bingo-style matrix. Each dialogue interaction and station visit is tagged to one or more VUCA dimensions. When all four dimensions are sufficiently covered, the journey concludes. By the end, every user understands what VUCA means through lived (simulated) experience.

## Intent
Without a finish line, the journey has no arc. The bingo matrix gives structure without rigidity — users reach the same destination through completely different paths. It also ensures pedagogical completeness: no user finishes without encountering all four dimensions.

## Dependencies
- FR-005 (Gemini AI dialogue engine — dimension tagging)
- FR-006 (VUCA navigation — journey steps)
