# BC-005: Portfolio-Backed Skill Verification

**Status:** draft
**Created:** 2026-02-17

## Concept
The skill profile's credibility comes from its evidence chain. Every skill claim is backed by a reference to a portfolio entry — a real, traceable interaction record from the multimodal storage layer. This is not self-assessment. This is system-observed, data-backed competency documentation.

The evidence chain: **Profile → Skill Dimension → Portfolio Entry → Raw Interaction**

This structure enables:
- **Self-verification:** The student sees why their profile says what it says
- **Third-party verification:** With consent, an employer or chamber can audit the evidence
- **Future certification:** The evidence chain is the foundation for eventual methodological certification (TUeV/ISO) — the method of profile generation is auditable, not just the result

The portfolio is built automatically from the VUCA journey and Level 2 reflections. The student does not "upload evidence" — the evidence emerges from genuine interaction. This is the key innovation: the act of learning IS the act of documenting.

## Value Proposition
- **For students:** "This is proof of who I am, not just what I claim"
- **For employers:** Verifiable signals beyond CVs and interviews
- **For the platform:** The evidence chain is the moat — no competitor can replicate years of portfolio data

## Revenue / Impact
- Verified profiles command higher matching premiums
- Evidence-backed profiles are more valuable to employers than interest-only profiles
- Foundation for eventual paid certification service

## Risks
- Evidence quality depends on interaction quality (garbage in, garbage out)
- Privacy implications of detailed interaction records as "evidence"
- Students may feel surveilled if the evidence mechanism is not transparent
