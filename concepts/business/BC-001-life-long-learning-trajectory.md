# BC-001: Life-Long-Learning Trajectory

**Status:** draft
**Created:** 2026-02-17

## Concept
The skill/interest profile is not a snapshot — it is a trajectory. Future Skiller accompanies users across their entire learning journey: first exploration at 14, deepening during apprenticeship, pivoting at 25, upskilling at 40. The profile is a living document that grows, shifts, and matures with the person.

This is the core business lock-in: once a user has built years of profile data, switching costs are high. The trajectory is the moat.

Value accrues at every stage:
- **Youth (14-18):** Interest discovery, VUCA foundation, first Moeglichkeitsraum
- **Training (18-25):** Skill deepening, job matching, competency documentation
- **Career (25-45):** Transition support, upskilling paths, profile-based matching
- **Lifelong (45+):** Reinvention, portfolio career support

## Value Proposition
- **For users:** A single place that knows their full learning history and growing competency
- **For employers:** Access to verified, long-term skill trajectories (not just a CV snapshot)
- **For the platform:** Compounding data value — each year of use makes the profile more valuable

## Revenue / Impact
- Monetization scales with trajectory length: matching, premium analytics, and enterprise access all become more valuable with richer profiles
- Retention is built into the model — the profile is worth more the longer you use it
- Network effects: as more profiles exist, matching quality improves for all stakeholders

## Risks
- User churn in early years before enough value has accumulated
- Privacy concerns around long-term personal data storage
- Regulatory changes (GDPR evolution) around lifelong data retention
- Competing platforms with shorter time-to-value
