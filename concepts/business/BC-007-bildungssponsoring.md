# BC-007: Bildungssponsoring (Sponsored Content Revenue Model)

**Status:** draft
**Created:** 2026-02-17

## Concept
We aim to overcome traditional advertising. Sponsoring by companies with trusted content is where we want to go — back to the original model where companies earned trust by sharing genuine expertise, not by buying attention.

### The Philosophical Foundation: Trust Before Transaction

Before the modern ad industry corrupted the relationship between companies and people, businesses built trust by sharing real knowledge. The historical examples are instructive:

- **Michelin (1900)**: Created the restaurant guide — not to advertise tires, but to give drivers reasons to drive. The guide became more trusted and more valuable than any tire ad could ever be.
- **Jell-O (1904)**: Published free recipe books that taught people to cook. The recipes created genuine value. The brand became synonymous with trusted kitchen knowledge.
- **John Deere (1895)**: Published "The Furrow" magazine for farmers — real agricultural advice, not product pitches. Still in print 130 years later.

These companies understood: **if you teach someone something real, they trust you. If you interrupt them with a pitch, they resent you.**

The modern ad industry broke this model. Targeting, tracking, interruption, attention-harvesting — it optimized for clicks, not for trust. Even when today's technologies (contextual placement, engagement analytics, audience segmentation) are powerful tools, they have been weaponized against users.

**Future Skiller reclaims the original model.** We use modern technology (contextual matching, engagement signals, AI-generated content integration) but we point it at trust and learning, not at attention capture. Companies earn visibility by contributing genuine expertise — the way Michelin earned trust by helping people find good restaurants.

### The Nescafe Principle (from transcript)
"Wir schaffen Sichtbarkeit fuer das Unternehmen. Und warum? Weil du als Unternehmen eine Expertise hast, die unseren Kunden nuetzt." — "Diese alte Werbewelt will ich gerne ueberwinden."

If a student's VUCA journey leads through coffee cultivation in Brazil, a Nescafe specialist's expertise about coffee production adds genuine educational value. The student learns something real. The company gains visibility in a context where their expertise matters. The match is organic, not forced.

### The Trust Test
Every piece of sponsored content must pass one question: **"Would this content be valuable to the student even if the company behind it didn't exist?"** If yes, it belongs. If no, it's advertising in disguise and must be rejected.

### How It Works
1. **Content Contribution**: Company provides domain expertise, stories, challenges, or real-world scenarios
2. **Contextual Placement**: Content appears when a student's journey intersects with the company's domain
3. **Transparent Labeling**: "Supported by [Company]" — always visible, never hidden
4. **Educational Quality Gate**: All sponsored content must pass a quality threshold (educational value > promotional value)
5. **Interest Signal**: If a student engages deeply with sponsored content, this becomes a matching signal (with consent)

### Distinction from Advertising
| Dimension | Ad Industry | Bildungssponsoring |
|---|---|---|
| **Intent** | Capture attention | Build understanding |
| **Content** | Promotional message | Genuine domain expertise |
| **Control** | Company controls message | Company provides expertise, platform curates |
| **Targeting** | Demographics, behavioral tracking | Organic context match (student's own journey) |
| **User role** | Student is the product (data sold) | Student is the beneficiary (knowledge gained) |
| **Consent** | Opt-out (if at all) | Explicit opt-in, full transparency |
| **Trust dynamic** | Erodes trust over time | Builds trust over time |
| **Success metric** | Clicks, impressions, conversions | Learning outcomes, genuine interest signals |
| **Long-term effect** | Ad fatigue, ad blockers, resentment | Earned reputation, organic matching |

### Modern Tech, Original Values
We DO use modern technology: contextual matching algorithms, engagement analytics, audience understanding, A/B testing of content effectiveness. These tools are powerful. But we point them at a different target:

| We use this technology... | ...to achieve this goal |
|---|---|
| Contextual placement | Deliver the right expertise at the right moment in the journey |
| Engagement analytics | Measure learning impact, not click-through rates |
| Interest profiling | Match students to companies where genuine interest exists |
| Content optimization | Improve educational quality, not conversion rates |

The infrastructure may resemble ad-tech. The purpose is the opposite.

## Value Proposition
- **Students**: Richer, more authentic learning experiences grounded in real-world expertise
- **Companies**: Meaningful visibility to genuinely interested future talent — far better than a job listing
- **Platform**: Sustainable B2B revenue that aligns incentives (educational quality = commercial success)

## Revenue / Impact
- **Sponsoring tiers**: Basic (content contribution) → Premium (branded stations, challenge sponsoring) → Enterprise (full domain sponsoring)
- **Volume pricing**: Per-impression or per-engagement based on student interactions with sponsored content
- **Match premium**: Additional fee when sponsored content leads to a successful match interaction
- **Estimated revenue**: Post-MVP, once user base reaches 10,000+ active students

## Risks
- Quality degradation if commercial pressure overrides educational value → strict editorial policy needed
- Student trust erosion if sponsoring feels like advertising → transparent labeling is non-negotiable
- Regulatory: youth advertising regulations in Germany are strict (JMStV) → must qualify as educational, not promotional
- Dependency on company participation for content quality → maintain strong LLM-generated baseline
