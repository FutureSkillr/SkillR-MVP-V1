# BC-002: Job-Navigator

**Status:** draft
**Created:** 2026-02-17

## Concept
The Job-Navigator is a domain-specific guidance system that translates interest profiles into concrete job possibilities. It does not recommend — it reveals. Using real job portal data and Wikipedia knowledge, it explains to students what jobs exist, what they involve, and how they connect to the student's interests.

Key differentiators:
- **Gegensatzsuche:** Deliberately offers contrasting job ideas to widen the Moeglichkeitsraum
- **Interest-based, not grade-based:** Suggestions come from what the student cares about, not test scores
- **Grounded in real data:** Job descriptions and demand data from actual portals, not generic databases
- **Student-friendly language:** Complex job descriptions are translated into age-appropriate explanations using Wikipedia as a knowledge backbone

The Job-Navigator is a natural monetization surface: employers and chambers (IHK) pay to be visible in the possibility space. But in the MVP, it serves purely as a discovery tool.

## Value Proposition
- **For students:** "I didn't know this job existed" — expanding awareness beyond family/school horizon
- **For employers:** Direct pipeline to interest-matched future talent (post-MVP)
- **For IHK/chambers:** Tool that makes their apprenticeship landscape visible to youth

## Revenue / Impact
- Post-MVP: Sponsored job listings, employer branding within the Moeglichkeitsraum
- Post-MVP: IHK partnerships for apprenticeship visibility
- MVP: No revenue — pure discovery tool to validate engagement

## Risks
- Job data quality and freshness from portal APIs
- Risk of perceived career recommendation (must stay in "possibility" framing)
- Legal considerations around job suggestions to minors
