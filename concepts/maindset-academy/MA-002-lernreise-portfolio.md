## Concept

The **Lernreise Portfolio** is the core offering of maindset.ACADEMY. It consists of three distinct learning journeys, each targeting a different dimension of personal development. Each Lernreise is powered by maindfull.LEARNING's AI engine and delivered through SkillR's platform.

### The Three Lernreisen

| Lernreise | Focus | VUCA Dimension | Status |
|-----------|-------|----------------|--------|
| **Reise nach VUCA** | Interest and skill discovery | All (V, U, C, A) | MVP — active development |
| **Unternehmergeist** | Entrepreneurial mindset and initiative | Complexity, Ambiguity | Concept phase |
| **[Third Lernreise TBD]** | TBD | TBD | Future |

### How Lernreisen Work

Each Lernreise follows the same structural pattern:

1. **Entry:** Student selects a Lernreise from the maindset.ACADEMY catalog
2. **Journey:** AI-guided dialogue explores the Lernreise's domain through the VUCA Bingo matrix
3. **Reflection:** maindfull.LEARNING triggers Level 2 Reflection at key moments
4. **Completion:** Student fills the VUCA Bingo matrix (4 items × 4 dimensions)
5. **Profile:** A skill/interest profile is generated from the journey data

### Powered by maindfull.LEARNING

The AI engine provides:
- Smart course delivery (DC-009) — adaptive content based on student responses
- VUCA Bingo tracking (DC-001) — progress monitoring across dimensions
- Gegensatzsuche (DC-002) — deliberate contrasting suggestions to widen perspective
- Level 2 Reflection (DC-004) — coaching-mode interventions
- Interest→Skills transformation (DC-005) — converting raw interests into skill profiles

### Relationship to Skill Sets and Learning Paths

- **Lernreisen** are the top-level educational products
- **Skill Sets** (MA-003) are curated groups of skills within a Lernreise
- **Learning Paths** (MA-004) structure progression through a Lernreise

## Target Group
