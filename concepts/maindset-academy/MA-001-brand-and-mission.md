### What maindset.ACADEMY Is

maindset.ACADEMY is an AI-powered learning academy where young people (14+) discover their interests, develop skills, and explore their Moeglichkeitsraum (possibility space) through gamified, dialogue-based Lernreisen (learning journeys). The result is a personal skill/interest profile — not a career recommendation.

### Mission

> Junge Menschen befähigen, ihre Interessen zu entdecken und ihre Zukunft aktiv zu gestalten.
>
> (Empower young people to discover their interests and actively shape their future.)

- **SkillR** is the kids education brand: app on top of maindfull.LEARNING, with Solid Pod-based lifelong profiles and a learning-sponsoring module (resellable to third parties)
- SkillR is NOT the infrastructure provider — it is a consumer of the platform provided by maindset.ACADEMY

### Relationship to maindfull.LEARNING
