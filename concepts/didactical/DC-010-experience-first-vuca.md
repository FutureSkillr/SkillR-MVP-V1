# DC-010: Experience-First VUCA (Erleben vor Benennen)

**Status:** draft
**Created:** 2026-02-18

## Concept

A user said it plainly: *"I don't care about VUCA. No matter what you name it, I need to know those things, but I don't care how it's called. I want to experience it, and later, I might be informed about the theoretical concept, so that I can remember and grasp it."*

This is the foundational UX principle: **Experience first. Name later.**

### The Inversion

Traditional education: Name → Explain → Practice → Test
Future Skiller: **Experience → Reflect → Name → Remember**

The student helps a chef in Rome manage a crisis when ingredients don't arrive. They experience Volatility — price fluctuations, supply chain disruptions, plan B improvisation. At no point does anyone say the word "Volatility." The experience IS the learning.

Later — after they've lived through it — the system reveals: *"Weisst du was? Das, was du gerade erlebt hast, nennt man Volatilitaet. So fuehlt sich das an, wenn Plaene sich aendern und du trotzdem liefern musst."*

Now the theoretical concept has a MEMORY attached. It's not abstract. It's "that time I had to reroute the ingredient delivery in Rome." The concept sticks because the experience came first.

### Why This Matters for the Product

1. **Teenagers reject academic framing.** "VUCA" sounds like school. "Reise nach VUCA" sounds like a branded curriculum. The journey should feel like a world adventure that HAPPENS to teach VUCA concepts — not a VUCA curriculum wrapped in adventure skin.

2. **The VUCA Bingo Matrix (DC-001) is invisible.** Students see: passport stamps, explored places, growing profile. They do NOT see: "V: 3/4, U: 2/4, C: 4/4, A: 1/4." The matrix is the system's quality gate, not the student's interface.

3. **Theoretical naming is a REWARD, not a prerequisite.** When a VUCA dimension is fully experienced (4 items in the matrix), the system reveals the concept: *"Du hast jetzt Ambiguitaet gemeistert — die Faehigkeit, mit Uneindeutigkeit umzugehen. Erinnerst du dich an die Situation in Tokyo, wo du nicht wusstest, ob das Projekt Kunst oder Technik war? Das war Ambiguitaet."* This is a celebration moment, not a lesson.

4. **The product name doesn't need "VUCA."** The student-facing brand should be about the journey: "Future Skiller — Deine Weltreise." The VUCA framework is the pedagogical engine under the hood, like how a car engine powers the experience without the driver needing to understand combustion.

### Implementation

- Station scenarios NEVER mention VUCA dimensions by name
- The AI coach frames everything as story and experience
- After completing a VUCA dimension (4/4 in matrix), a "reveal moment" explains the concept
- The reveal links back to specific experiences: "Remember when you did X? That was Y."
- A "Wissen" (knowledge) section in the profile collects revealed concepts — available for review but never required
- The VUCA Bingo Matrix label in the UI (if visible at all) uses experience-language: "Entdeckt", "Erlebt", "Gemeistert" — not "V", "U", "C", "A"

## Target Group
All users. But especially teenagers (14-16) who will disengage immediately if the product feels like a disguised school lesson.

## Validation
- Do students complete VUCA dimensions without knowing the names?
- When the concept is revealed, do students say "Ah, THAT'S what it's called" (recognition) vs. "So what?" (indifference)?
- Does the reveal moment feel like a reward or like a lecture?
- Can a student explain Volatility in their own words by referencing their Rome experience?
