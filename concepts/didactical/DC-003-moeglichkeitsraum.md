# DC-003: Moeglichkeitsraum (Possibility Space)

**Status:** draft
**Created:** 2026-02-17

## Concept
The Moeglichkeitsraum is the conceptual space of all possibilities — jobs, skills, interests, life paths — that are available to a person based on their evolving interest profile. It is not a fixed map but a living, expanding space that grows as the student explores.

The Moeglichkeitsraum is the central value proposition across the life-long-learning trajectory. At age 14, the space is wide and exploratory. At 20, it narrows with experience but deepens with expertise. At 35, it shifts with career change. The system tracks and visualizes this space over time.

Key properties:
- **Expansive by default** — the system always tries to widen the space, not narrow it
- **Interest-driven boundaries** — the space is shaped by what the student explores, not by external constraints
- **Gegensatzsuche as expansion mechanism** — contrasting options actively push the boundaries outward
- **Job-Navigator as concretizer** — real job data grounds the abstract space in actual career possibilities

## Target Group
All users across the life-long-learning trajectory. The concept scales from first-time youth exploration to adult career transitions.

## Implementation
- The Moeglichkeitsraum is derived from the interest profile + job data + Gegensatzsuche results
- Visualization: an expanding map, cluster diagram, or network graph of possibilities
- Each journey interaction can expand or refine the space
- The Job-Navigator populates the space with real job options from portal data

## Validation
- Does the student feel their options are opening up, not closing down?
- Does the space feel personal (not generic)?
- Can the Moeglichkeitsraum be meaningfully shown to a third party (parent, IHK)?
- Does it grow across sessions?
