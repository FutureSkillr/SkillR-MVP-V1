# DC-005: Interest → Orientation → Skills Transformation

**Status:** draft
**Created:** 2026-02-17

## Concept
The learning journey follows a three-stage transformation model:

### Stage 1: Interest (Interesse)
Pure curiosity. The student names something that attracts them. No commitment, no depth required. The system captures this as the seed.
- **Signal:** Topic choice, engagement duration, return frequency
- **Profile state:** Interest tags, no skill claims
- **VUCA journey:** Early exploration, wide Moeglichkeitsraum

### Stage 2: Orientation (Orientierung)
Understanding emerges. The student has explored dimensions, encountered VUCA, seen the landscape. They know what working in this domain means — the real complexity, the variety of roles, the connection to other fields.
- **Signal:** Multi-dimensional exploration, Gegensatzsuche engagement, Job-Navigator usage
- **Profile state:** Interest depth, orientation indicators, emerging capability signals
- **VUCA journey:** Mid-to-late journey, Moeglichkeitsraum is taking shape

### Stage 3: Skills (Kompetenzen)
Competency is demonstrated. Portfolio entries evidence analytical depth, creative problem-solving, domain knowledge. The profile makes verifiable claims backed by data.
- **Signal:** Level 2 reflection depth, sustained engagement, cross-domain connections
- **Profile state:** Portfolio-backed skill dimensions, capability indicators
- **VUCA journey:** Complete or deep into second/third cycle

The transformation is not one-way. A student can be at Stage 3 for "Holz" and Stage 1 for "Erneuerbare Energien" simultaneously. The profile is multi-dimensional.

This model works at any age. A 45-year-old re-entering starts at Stage 1 for new interests but may carry Stage 3 evidence from previous domains. The system respects accumulated experience.

## Target Group
All users across the life-long-learning trajectory. The model scales from first exploration to career reinvention.

## Implementation
- Profile UI shows the current stage per interest domain
- Stage transitions are data-driven (not self-reported)
- Portfolio entries accumulate as evidence for stage advancement
- Stage 3 skills are matchable; Stage 1 interests are exploratory
- The system encourages progression but never forces it

## Validation
- Can a student see their own progression through stages?
- Does Stage 2 (Orientation) feel meaningfully different from Stage 1 (Interest)?
- Are Stage 3 skill claims credible to a third party?
- Does the model work for a 45-year-old re-enterer, not just a 14-year-old?
