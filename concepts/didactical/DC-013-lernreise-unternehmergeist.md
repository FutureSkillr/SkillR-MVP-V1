# DC-013: Lernreise "Unternehmergeist" (Entrepreneur Journey)

**Status:** draft
**Created:** 2026-02-18

## Concept

Parents told us: *"We want our kids to become entrepreneurs."*

The Entrepreneur Journey is one of THREE core learning trips in Future Skiller (see DC-015). Where the VUCA trip explores "What interests me and what is the world like?" and the Self-Learning trip explores "How do I learn?", the Entrepreneur trip explores "How do I create something of my own?"

### Three Journeys, One Profile

│   source literacy, persistence)   │
│                                   │

The student can switch between trips or do all three in parallel. Progress is tracked separately but the profile combines insights from all journeys.

### The Entrepreneur Target Matrix

Like VUCA has 4 dimensions (V, U, C, A), the Entrepreneur journey has its own target matrix:

| Dimension | What It Means | Example Station |
|---|---|---|
| **Idee** (Ideation) | See problems as opportunities, generate solutions | "In Mumbai gibt es kein sauberes Trinkwasser fuer 10.000 Menschen. Was faellt dir ein?" |
| **Machen** (Execution) | Turn ideas into action, prototype, iterate | "Du hast eine Idee fuer einen Wasserfilter. Bau einen Prototypen mit dem, was du hier findest." |
| **Team** (Collaboration) | Find co-founders, delegate, lead, communicate | "Du brauchst Hilfe. Wen holst du ins Team und warum?" |
| **Markt** (Market) | Understand customers, pricing, value exchange | "Wer wuerde deinen Wasserfilter kaufen? Was wuerde er kosten? Warum?" |
| **Scheitern** (Resilience) | Handle failure, pivot, learn from mistakes | "Dein erster Kunde sagt: zu teuer. Was machst du jetzt?" |

5 dimensions, 4 items each = 20 cells minimum for completion.

### How It Differs from VUCA

| VUCA Journey | Entrepreneur Journey |
|---|---|
| Explores the world AS IT IS | Imagines the world AS IT COULD BE |
| Observes, reflects, discovers | Creates, builds, tests |
| Profile output: interests + skills | Profile output: entrepreneurial capabilities |
| Station format: dialogue + reflection | Station format: challenge + creation + feedback |
| Social: individual journey | Social: team-based stations (invite friends) |
| Passive learning through experience | Active learning through building |

### Station Types for the Entrepreneur Journey

1. **Problem Stations**: The AI presents a real-world problem at a location. The student brainstorms solutions. (Dimension: Idee)

2. **Build Stations**: The student "builds" something — a prototype, a pitch, a plan. The AI simulates constraints (budget, materials, time). (Dimension: Machen)

3. **Team Stations**: Multi-player stations where the student invites a friend to collaborate. They must divide tasks and combine results. (Dimension: Team)

4. **Market Stations**: The student tests their creation against simulated customers. The AI plays different customer personas with different needs. (Dimension: Markt)

5. **Failure Stations**: Something goes wrong. The student must diagnose the problem, adapt, and try again. The AI deliberately introduces obstacles. (Dimension: Scheitern)

### Integration with the Globe

The Entrepreneur Journey uses the SAME globe/map as the VUCA journey. Entrepreneur stations appear at the same cities but with a different marker (e.g., a lightbulb icon vs. a compass icon). A student in Rome might see both:
- Compass: "Hilf einem Koch bei einer Krise" (VUCA station)
- Lightbulb: "Gruende ein Restaurant mit 500 EUR Budget" (Entrepreneur station)

## Target Group
- **Primary**: Teenagers whose parents value entrepreneurial thinking
- **Secondary**: Students who find the VUCA journey too passive and want to CREATE something
- **Tertiary**: Young adults (18-25) in Gruendungsprogramme who want to build entrepreneurial skills

## Implementation
- Separate target matrix (5 dimensions x 4 items = 20 cells)
- Same globe interface, different station markers
- Team stations require invite mechanics (FR-036)
- Build stations may involve simple interactive tools (canvas, calculator, timeline builder)
- Failure stations require the AI to intentionally create setbacks — a different prompt pattern than VUCA stations
- Profile section: "Unternehmergeist" appears as a separate layer alongside the VUCA skill dimensions

## Validation
- Do students who complete the Entrepreneur journey show measurably different problem-solving approaches?
- Do team stations drive invites and user base growth?
- Do parents specifically value the "Unternehmergeist" badge in the profile?
- Can the same AI engine generate compelling entrepreneurial scenarios?
