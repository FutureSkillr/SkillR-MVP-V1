# DC-002: Gegensatzsuche (Opposite Search)

**Status:** draft
**Created:** 2026-02-17

## Concept
Gegensatzsuche is a pedagogical technique where the system deliberately offers the student a contrasting or opposite perspective to their current interest or position. If a student is deep in "Holzhandwerk" (woodcraft), the system might offer "Kunststofftechnik" (plastics engineering) or "Digitale Fertigung" (digital fabrication) — not as a distraction, but as a mirror.

The purpose is twofold:
1. **Broaden the Moeglichkeitsraum** — the student discovers connections and options they would never have found in a linear exploration.
2. **Sharpen self-knowledge** — by confronting the opposite, the student understands their own preference more clearly. Rejecting the opposite is as informative as choosing it.

Gegensatzsuche is applied in both the VUCA journey navigation (FR-006) and the Job-Navigator (US-003).

## Target Group
All students. Especially valuable for those who fixate early on a single interest — Gegensatzsuche prevents tunnel vision without dismissing the original interest.

## Implementation
- The Gemini dialogue engine identifies the "semantic opposite" or "contrasting domain" for the current topic
- At navigation points, one of the two options is always a Gegensatz (contrast)
- In the Job-Navigator, contrary job suggestions are offered alongside related ones
- Student choices (accept or reject the contrast) are tracked as profile signals

## Validation
- Does the student feel challenged, not confused?
- Do contrast suggestions feel relevant, not random?
- Does rejecting a Gegensatz produce meaningful profile data?
- Does the mechanism prevent interest-bias in the profile?
