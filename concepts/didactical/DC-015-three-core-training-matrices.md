# DC-015: Three Core Training Matrices (Die Drei Lernreisen)

**Status:** draft
**Created:** 2026-02-18

## Concept

Future Skiller offers not one journey but THREE — each targeting a different dimension of personal development. Together, they form the complete Future Skiller learning system.

### Why Three — Not One, Not Twelve

- **One journey is too narrow.** VUCA alone covers "understanding the world" but misses "creating in the world" and "mastering your own learning."
- **Twelve would be overwhelming.** Teenagers need clarity, not a curriculum catalog. Three is the magic number: memorable, distinct, complete.
- **These three cover the full spectrum**: perceive (VUCA), create (Entrepreneur), and grow (Self-Learning). Every other skill or competency maps to one of these three.

### Journey 3: Selbstlernkompetenz (Self-Learning Competence)

The most future-proof skill is the ability to teach yourself. In a world where knowledge changes faster than curricula can update, the student who knows HOW to learn wins every time.

This journey is not about WHAT you learn — it is about HOW you learn, and whether you can do it independently.

#### The Self-Learning Target Matrix

| Dimension | What It Means | Example Station |
|---|---|---|
| **Lerntechnik** (Learning Techniques) | Know and apply different learning strategies: spaced repetition, active recall, Feynman technique, mind mapping | "Du hast 30 Minuten, dir alles ueber japanische Teezeremonie beizubringen. Welche Methode waehlst du?" |
| **Selbstreflexion** (Self-Reflection) | Recognize what you know, what you don't, and where you're stuck. Metacognitive awareness | "Du hast gerade die Station abgeschlossen. Was war einfach? Was war schwer? Warum?" |
| **Quellenarbeit** (Source Literacy) | Find, evaluate, and synthesize information from multiple sources. Distinguish reliable from unreliable | "Drei Quellen sagen drei verschiedene Dinge ueber Solarenergie. Welcher vertraust du? Warum?" |
| **Durchhaltevermoegen** (Persistence) | Stick with difficult material, manage frustration, develop learning stamina | "Dieses Thema ist komplex. Du bist seit 20 Minuten dran. Willst du aufhoeren? Oder findest du einen Weg, dranzubleiben?" |

4 dimensions, 4 items each = 16 cells minimum for completion.

#### Station Types for the Self-Learning Journey

1. **Method Stations**: The AI teaches a learning technique, then the student must APPLY it to learn something new. The technique is the objective, not the content. (Dimension: Lerntechnik)

2. **Mirror Stations**: The AI asks the student to reflect on their own learning process. What worked? What didn't? Why? These are metacognitive exercises. (Dimension: Selbstreflexion)

3. **Research Stations**: The student is given a question and must find the answer themselves — using provided sources, evaluating credibility, synthesizing findings. The AI plays the role of "bad source" sometimes. (Dimension: Quellenarbeit)

4. **Endurance Stations**: Deliberately challenging material that requires sustained effort. The AI monitors engagement and offers strategies when the student struggles — but does NOT give the answer. (Dimension: Durchhaltevermoegen)

#### How It Differs from the Other Two

| VUCA Journey | Entrepreneur Journey | Self-Learning Journey |
|---|---|---|
| "What is the world like?" | "What can I create?" | "How do I learn anything?" |
| Explores topics through AI dialogue | Solves problems through creation | Masters learning through method |
| Profile: interests + skills | Profile: entrepreneurial capabilities | Profile: learning competencies |
| Station: experience + reflect | Station: challenge + build + test | Station: learn + apply + reflect |
| External focus (world) | Creative focus (making) | Internal focus (self) |
| Passive → active spectrum | Active throughout | Meta-active (learning about learning) |

#### Integration with the Globe

The Self-Learning Journey uses the SAME globe as VUCA and Entrepreneur. Self-Learning stations appear with a distinct marker (e.g., a book/brain icon). A student in Tokyo might see:

- Compass: "Erlebe die Komplexitaet der Tokioter U-Bahn" (VUCA)
- Lightbulb: "Gruende einen Ramen-Stand mit 200 EUR" (Entrepreneur)
- Brain: "Drei japanische Meister haben unterschiedliche Philosophien. Finde heraus, wer Recht hat." (Self-Learning)

#### Why This Matters for the Product

**For students**: "Lernen lernen" is the one skill every teacher wishes they could teach but few curricula address. A journey dedicated to it fills a gap no school currently covers well.

**For parents**: "My child doesn't just learn facts — they learn HOW to learn." This is a powerful value proposition, especially for parents concerned about future-proofing.

**For IHK/employers**: Self-learning competence is the #1 requested meta-skill in apprenticeships. An Azubi who can teach themselves new tools and processes is worth more than one who memorized a textbook.

**For the profile**: Self-learning dimensions add a META-layer to the profile. The VUCA and Entrepreneur journeys show WHAT you can do. The Self-Learning journey shows HOW WELL you learn — a signal of future potential, not just current ability.

```

Each journey is independently completable. A student can do all three, or focus on one. The profile shows progress across all three, with the spider diagram reflecting dimensions from each journey.

### Unlock Sequence

Not all three journeys need to be available from day one:

| Journey | Unlock Condition | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| **VUCA** | Available at first launch | Core journey, entry point |
| **Unternehmergeist** | Available at Level 3 or via parent/teacher recommendation | Requires basic familiarity with the globe and station mechanics |
| **Selbstlernkompetenz** | Available at Level 5 or via teacher recommendation | Metacognition is harder; students need some journey experience first |

### Combined XP and Engagement

All three journeys share the same engagement system (DC-014):
- XP earned in ANY journey counts toward the same level and league
- Streaks count for completing at least 1 station from ANY journey
- Some achievements span journeys: "Complete 5 stations in each journey" = "Allrounder" badge

## Target Group

- **Primary**: All Future Skiller students — the Self-Learning journey complements any interest area
- **Secondary**: Teachers who want to use Future Skiller as a "learning to learn" tool
- **Tertiary**: Parents who value "learning how to learn" as a life skill

## Implementation

- Define a target matrix for the Self-Learning journey (4 dimensions x 4 items)
- Design station types (Method, Mirror, Research, Endurance) with distinct prompt patterns
- Add a journey selector to the globe UI — three icons, three colors, one world
- Profile spider diagram expands to show dimensions from all three journeys
- Smart Kurs engine (DC-009) handles all three with different target matrices
- Erinnerungsraum (TC-009) stores evidence tagged to the originating journey

## Validation

- Does the Self-Learning journey measurably improve learning outcomes in the other two journeys?
- Do students who complete all three journeys have richer, more credible profiles?
- Can teachers and employers distinguish the three profile layers meaningfully?
- Is 52 total matrix cells achievable without burning out the student?
